#strict

-- This file tests strict mode type enforcement

-- Function with type signature - should be validated in strict mode
let add = (a, b) -> a + b :: (Int, Int) :> Int

-- This should work
let result = add(5, 10)
result /> print  -- 15

-- Function without type signature - should NOT be validated
let noTypes = (x) -> x * 2
noTypes(5) /> print  -- 10 (works because no type signature)
