- Generating declaration files (.d.ts)

## Key Topics

- Strict null checks and undefined handling
- Discriminated unions for AST nodes
- Generic constraints and conditional types
- Type guards and narrowing
- Declaration file authoring

## Reference Files

- `references/generics.md` - Advanced generic patterns
- `references/type-guards.md` - Type narrowing techniques
